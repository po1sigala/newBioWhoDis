    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My background is in biology, my current passion is coding, and my goal is to utilize both in a world which is becoming ever increasingly multidisciplinary.

    I am dedicated to helping people and creating. This has led me to my current position within 
    the medical device industry. I am currently further expanding my range from creating cutting edge physical products (electric vehicles, surgical robots, and green pesticides) to include soft products using JavaScript and Node JS as my primary languages.
    I am looking to continue making products which make a lasting difference in the world.
